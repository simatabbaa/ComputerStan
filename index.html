	<h1>Comparison of Macbook and Powerbook</h1>
	<p>The MacBook Air and the PowerBook 500 are two very different computers that were released almost 30 years apart. The PowerBook 500 was released in 1994 and had a 33 MHz Motorola 68040 processor, a built-in graphics chip that was capable of displaying 256 colors, a 500 MB hard disk drive, and 4 MB of RAM. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, was released in 2008 and has an Apple M1 chip with an 8-core CPU (up to 3.2 GHz), an Apple M1 chip with a 7 or 8-core GPU (depending on the model), solid-state storage with options ranging from 128 GB to 2 TB, and 8 GB or 16 GB of unified memory (depending on the model). The MacBook Air is much more powerful and capable than the PowerBook 500, thanks to advances in processor technology, graphics technology, storage technology, and memory capacity.
